# Drone  Flight Simulator

# Over view
This is a drone flight simulator where the input data give is a representation of the movements the drone takes. The characters `^v<>` are for up, down, left and right respectively and `x` means that a  photo  was taken on that square.

# Deployed Link

# Design decisions
This was just a data processing challenge. We build an object to contain all the input drone data and then build a  plane where we display it.

# Future Plans
* add functionality to include your own input string
* pause render at any point by clicking `space`
